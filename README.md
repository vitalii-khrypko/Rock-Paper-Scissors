# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using JavaScript. Players can choose one of the three options, and the game will determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

## Technologies
- **HTML5** - for the structure of the page.
- **CSS3** - for styling the interface.
- **JavaScript** - for implementing the game logic.

## Features
- Players can select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The game randomly selects one of the options for the computer.
- The result of the game (win, lose, or draw) is displayed after each round.
- The score is tracked and updated with each round.
